# Reservation Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The original large `ReservationService` has been successfully refactored into smaller, focused services organized in a dedicated folder structure within the Infrastructure project.

## New Folder Structure
```
TL.Infrastructure/
??? Reservation/
    ??? ReservationConstants.cs
    ??? ReservationValidationService.cs
    ??? ReservationStatusManager.cs
    ??? ReservationPricingService.cs
    ??? ReservationQueryService.cs
    ??? ReservationManagementService.cs
```

## Service Breakdown

### 1. **ReservationConstants.cs**
- Contains all reservation-related constants
- Status codes (NEW, UNPAID, PARTPAY, FULLPAID, CANCELED)
- Business rules constants (MAX_GUESTS_PER_RESERVATION)

### 2. **ReservationValidationService.cs**
- **Responsibility**: All validation logic
- **Key Methods**:
  - `ValidateReservationData()` - Main validation orchestrator
  - `ValidateRequiredFields()` - Ensures all required fields are present
  - `ValidateForeignKeys()` - Validates referenced entities exist and are active
  - `ValidateDates()` - Date range and business date validations
  - `ValidateRoomCapacity()` - Guest counts vs room capacity
  - `ValidateGuestCounts()` - Guest count business rules
  - `ValidatePaymentAmounts()` - Payment amount validations
  - `ValidateBusinessRules()` - Hotel-room relationships and hotel availability
  - `ValidateRoomAvailability()` - Room booking conflicts
  - `ValidatePaymentUpdateRestrictions()` - Prevents updates to paid reservations

### 3. **ReservationStatusManager.cs**
- **Responsibility**: Reservation status determination logic
- **Key Methods**:
  - `DetermineReservationStatus()` - Calculates status based on payment ratio
  - Handles manual status overrides (like CANCELED)
  - Payment ratio calculations (0%, partial, 100%+)

### 4. **ReservationPricingService.cs**
- **Responsibility**: Price calculations and updates
- **Key Methods**:
  - `CalculateTotalPriceFromRooms()` - Sums room prices
  - `UpdateReservationTotalPrice()` - Updates reservation total

### 5. **ReservationQueryService.cs**
- **Responsibility**: Read operations and data retrieval
- **Key Methods**:
  - `GetAll()` - Retrieves all active reservations with joins
  - `GetById()` - Retrieves single reservation with full details

### 6. **ReservationManagementService.cs**
- **Responsibility**: CRUD operations orchestration
- **Key Methods**:
  - `AddEdit()` - Main create/update orchestrator
  - `CreateNewReservation()` - New reservation creation flow
  - `UpdateExistingReservation()` - Existing reservation update flow
  - `Delete()` - Soft delete operations
  - Helper methods for entity updates

### 7. **ReservationService.cs** (Main/Orchestrator)
- **Responsibility**: Public interface implementation and service coordination
- **Dependencies**: Injects and coordinates all sub-services
- **Logging**: Centralized logging for all operations
- **Interface**: Implements `IReservationService`

## Benefits of This Refactoring

### ? **Single Responsibility Principle**
Each service has one clear purpose and responsibility.

### ? **Maintainability**
- Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- Reduced risk when making changes
- Clear separation of concerns

### ? **Testability**
- Each service can be unit tested independently
- Easy to mock dependencies
- Focused test scenarios

### ? **Readability**
- Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand
- Clear naming conventions
- Logical organization

### ? **Reusability**
- Individual services can be reused in other contexts
- Validation service can be used for different endpoints
- Pricing service can be used for estimates

### ? **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new validation rules
- New pricing strategies can be implemented
- Status management can be enhanced independently

## Key Improvements Made

### **Comprehensive Validation**
- ? Complete foreign key validation
- ? All required fields validated
- ? Business rule validation
- ? Room availability conflict detection
- ? Payment update restrictions

### **Better Error Handling**
- Clear, descriptive error messages
- Specific validation failures
- Room booking conflict details

### **Code Organization**
- Logical folder structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear dependencies between services

### **Performance Considerations**
- Efficient queries with proper joins
- Minimal database calls
- Optimized room availability checks

## Usage
The main `ReservationService` remains the public interface, so no changes are needed in controllers or dependency injection. The refactoring is completely internal to the Infrastructure layer.

## Dependencies
Each service receives only the dependencies it needs:
- Database context for data access
- Other services for specific functionality
- Logger for the main service only

This creates a clean, maintainable, and extensible reservation management system.
